    <h2>💫 How We Met</h2>
    <p>We met in January this year (you claim not to remember, lol). I helped you with quotes and all your questions. It was on your second visit—with your cousin—that I noticed you might be into me.</p>
    <p>You called once telling me you were going to buy me (which you never gave 😅 and ngiyayi funa). The fourth time, you brought McDonald's and asked for my number... to which I didn’t give (lol).</p>
    <p>When you came to collect your lenses, you caught me off guard, and I finally gave in. From there, it just clicked. You were impulsive and sweet. I enjoyed my first sleepover and the second(loved it the most, hehe), and you were respectful from the start.</p>
    <p>Now, even with the distance between us right now, I know we're growing into something real. I feel a little lucky to have you 💙</p>

      <p>Happy Birthday, one of my favorite humans on this planet. You bring laughter, joy, and just the right amount of chaos to my life(yhiii) — and I love every second of it.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being kind, goofy, respectful, and real. Here’s to more late-night chats, cuddles, and McDonald's dates. I see something special in you — and in us.</p>
      <p>With love, always,<br><strong>Your Baby Girl 💙</strong></p>
